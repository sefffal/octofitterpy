# octofitterpy

`octofitterpy` is a python package for performing Bayesian inference 
against a wide variety of exoplanet / binary star data. It uses the [Octofitter.jl](https://sefffal.github.io/Octofitter.jl/)
julia package under the hood (just like eg numpy uses C).

`octofitterpy` can access almost all functionality of Octofitter.jl. Currently a subset of this functionality including relative astrometry fitting, absolute astrometry fitting, and various plotting functions have been wrapped with convenient python functions. Remaining functionality can be accessed via the `octofitterpy.Octofitter` submodule.


The `examples` directory and [demo notebook](https://github.com/sefffal/octofitterpy/blob/master/examples/demo.ipynb) provide an introduction to using octofitter in Python.
Extensive documentation and tutorials are available [here](https://sefffal.github.io/Octofitter.jl/) for the Julia version, and for the most part are directly translatable to Python.

## Installation
In python 3.8 to 3.11 based environment, run:
```bash
pip install -U octofitterpy
```

## Example
```python
import octofitterpy as octo

# See demo.ipynb for more details
astrom_like = octo.PlanetRelAstromLikelihood(
    epoch = [50000,50120],
    sep = [505.7,600.1],
    pa = [0.0,0.4,],
    σ_sep = [10,10],
    σ_pa = [0.01,0.01],
    cor= [0,0.2]
)
planet_b = octo.Planet(
    name="b",
    basis="Visual{KepOrbit}",
    priors=
    """            
        a ~ LogUniform(0.1, 500)
        e ~ Uniform(0.0, 0.99)
        i ~ Sine()
        ω ~ UniformCircular()
        Ω ~ UniformCircular()
        θ ~ UniformCircular()
        tp = θ_at_epoch_to_tperi(system,b,50000) # use MJD epoch of your data here!!
    """,
    likelihoods=[astrom_like]
)
sys = octo.System(
    name="HIP100123",
    priors = 
    """
        M ~ truncated(Normal(1.2, 0.1), lower=0)
        plx ~ truncated(Normal(50.0, 0.02), lower=0)
    """,
    likelihoods=[],
    companions=[planet_b]
)
model = octo.LogDensityModel(sys) # Compile model
chain = octo.octofit(model) # Sample model
octo.octoplot(model,chain) # Plot orbits
octo.octocorner(model,chain,small=True) # Make corner plot
octo.savechains("table.fits", chain)
```
